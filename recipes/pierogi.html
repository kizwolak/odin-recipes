    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My favourite food. Delicious. Polish. Make it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1⅓ (15 ounce) containers farmer's cheese</li>
        <li>7 potatoes, peeled and boiled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2½ cups mushrooms, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pass farmer's cheese and cooked potatoes separately through a food grinder or food processor.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook mushrooms and onions until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Combine farmer's cheese, potatoes, mushroom mixture, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix together and set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Place flour on a clean work surface and make a well in the center. Crack both eggs into the well. Add butter and a few tablespoons of the warm water. Mix with your hands, gradually adding more warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as you go. Knead well, continuing to add more water as needed. Knead until dough is soft and smooth, adding more flour to the work surface as needed.</li>
        <li>Cut off 1/4 of the dough and roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut out circles using a glass or a round pastry cutter, saving the excess dough for your next batch.</li>
        <li>Fill each dough circle with 1 teaspoon of filling. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and pinch edges together to seal. Cover with a clean dish towel so pierogi won't dry out and repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add the pierogi in batches, about 20 at a time, and cook until they float to the surface, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain in a strainer. Repeat with the remaining pierogi.</li>
    </ol>
