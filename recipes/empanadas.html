    <ul>
        <li>375g plain flour</li>
        <li>220g chilled butter, chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100g cooking chorizo sausage</li>
        <li>300g beef mince</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ small pack coriander, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ small pack parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the flour into a bowl with 1 tsp salt and add the butter. Rub the butter and flour with your fingertips until crumbly. Add the eggs and 100ml cold water, bring together to a dough then turn out onto a floured surface and begin to knead until soft and smooth. Cover with cling film and put in the fridge to rest for 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Remove the chorizo from its casing and add to a mixing bowl with the mince, onion, coriander, parsley, paprika, cumin and chilli flakes. Mix everything together, then cook in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2 mins. Add the tomato purée and cook for a further 7-10 mins until everything is cooked through. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Divide the dough into four portions and roll out each one into a thin sheet. Use a 10cm biscuit cutter to cut out discs. Place 1 tsp of filling in the centre of each disc, wet the edges, pinch both sides up and fold in half to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges.</li>
        <li>Arrange on a lined baking tray, brush with beaten egg and bake for 20 mins. When the empanadas are ready, remove from the oven and cool for 5 mins before serving.</li>
    </ol>
